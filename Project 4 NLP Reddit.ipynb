       "Welcome to the daily [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com) thread!\\n\\nPlease post all related topics *only* here and do not fill the subreddit with threads.\\n\\nThe rules are:\\n \\n+ **No direct code posting of solutions** - solutions are only allowed on source code hosters, like: [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com) (only for single classes/files!), [Github](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) - anonymous submissions are, of course allowed where the hosters allow (Github Gist and Pastebin do). We encourage people to use *git repos* (maybe with non-personally identifiable accounts to prevent doxing) - this also provides a learning effect as *git* is an extremely important skill to have.\\n+ Discussions about solutions are welcome and encouraged\\n+ Questions about the challenges are welcome and encouraged\\n+ Asking for *help* with solving the challenges is encouraged, still the *no complete solutions* rule applies.

(Do not just dump Kickstarter or trailer links)**\\n\\n* If you post something, try to leave some feedback on somebody else's post. It's good manners.\\n\\n* If you do post some feedback, try to make sure it's good feedback: make sure it has the **what** (\"The logo sucks...\") and the **why** (\"...because it's hard to read on most backgrounds\").\\n\\n* A very wide spectrum of items can be posted here, but try to limit yourself to **one or two important items** in your post to prevent it from being cluttered up.\\n\\n* Promote good feedback, and upvote those who do! Also, don't forget to thank the people who took some of their time to write some feedback for you, even if you don't agree with it.\\n\\n**Note:** Using url shorteners is discouraged as it may get you caught by Reddit's spam filter.\\n\\n----\\n\\n[All Previous Marketing Mondays](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/search?q=flair:MM&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     4\n",

       "**What is WIP Wednesday?**\\n\\nShare your work-in-progress (WIP) prototype, feature, art, model or work-in-progress game here and get early feedback from, and give early feedback to, other game developers.\\n\\n**RULES**\\n\\n* Do promote good feedback and interesting posts, and upvote those who posted it! Also, don't forget to thank the people who took some of their time to write some feedback or encouraging words for you, even if you don't agree with what they said.\\n* Do state what kind of feedback you want. We realise this may be hard, but please be as specific as possible so we can help each other best. \\n* Do leave feedback to at least 2 other posts.

       "Windows 10 i7 4770k 16GB DDR3 Motherboard: MSI Z87-G45 Gaming motherboard Nvidia 780 GTX\\n\\nSymptoms:\\n\\nThe on board sound from my motherboard just doesn't sound right. The sound is kind of \"tinny\" or \"sharp\" and there is a bit of static at higher volumes, some echoes as well. I'm using Audio Technica ath-m50x headphones plugged into the headphone jack of my tower desktop.\\n\\nExample: Playing Mass Effect 1; scrolling through the main menu options produces a \"tick\" sound. This sound is so loud and sharp it is almost like nails on a chalk board. Sound in general just doesn't sound very clean, almost very treble like.\\n\\nPlaying any game: When the sound increases suddenly in volume a hint of static can be heard, does not sound right.\\n\\nI built this PC back in 2013. Since then, I have been using Bose Companion 2 Series III Multimedia Speakers and do not recall any audio distortions when plugging my headphones into the 3.5mm jack. I took a break of several months away from PC gaming and came back to find my speakers no longer working. To remedy this, I plugged my headphones into the green audio jack of my PC tower only to discover the symptoms listed above. This was not the first time my Bose speakers went bad and I cannot recall the on board sound distortions occurring in the past when I've used it. Over 15 years of PC gaming intuition tells me that this audio just doesn't sound right.\\n\\nTroubleshooting steps taken:\\n\\nHere is the specs on the motherboard I have: https://us.msi.com/Motherboard/Z87-G45-GAMING.html#hero-specification\\n\\nI've tried updating drivers, uninstalling the Realtek software, just not sure if I'm doing everything correctly. I'll include screenshots of my device manager and sound setup.\\n\\nDevice Manager: http://m.imgur.com/a/9Akbx\\n\\nThanks for help anyone can give. Not sure if I need a dedicated sound card or if my headphones hooked up to speakers would help out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3\n",
       "I have a 2D drawing of a map, composed of straight lines. Every line is stored as an ordered pair of 2D points (start and end points), and I would like to remove both duplicate and redundant lines... Which seems to be way harder than it sounds.\\n\\nSo far I've divided the problem in the following cases - Let's say the format is (startX,startY), (endX,endY). \\n\\n\\n- Case 1: both lines are (0,0),(0,1).  Simplest one, easy to check.\\n\\n- Case 2: one line is (0,0),(0,1) and the other is (0,1),(0,0) - that is to say, same lines but their start and end points are switched. No problems so far.\\n\\n\\n- Case 3: One line is (0,0),(10,0) and the other is (0,0),(5,0). - They share a point and direction, and the second one should be removed because the whole line \"fits\" inside the first. Still no trouble.\\n\\n- Case 4: one line is (0,0),(0,6) and the other is (0,1),(0,4) - Same as case 3, but this time they don't share start nor end points. Now we're talking.\\n\\n- Case 5: One line is (0,0),(10,0) and the other is (10,0),(11,0) - since they are continuous, they should be combined in just a (0,0),(11,0) line. \\n\\n- Case 6: One line is (3,0),(10,0), the other is  (8,0),(11,0): they share no points, yet they overlap and should be simplified to one. I think this and case 4 can be combined into one generic case.\\n\\n\\nThose examples use simple lines, but lines aren't necessarily paralel to the axis: (2,4)(30,0) is a perfectly valid one.\\n\\nAny idea on how to approach the problem? I think calculating all the possible combinations is going to take forever, and I don't even know how to approach the cases where no common start and end points are shared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",

What should I do in that regard?\\n\\nAny help is much appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2\n",
       "Having learned the basics of python not so long ago, I am currently reading up on SQL in order to gain some exposures to database -- all for the purpose of bringing my web idea to life (one that relies heavily on user content and user interaction.)  \\n  \\nThere seems to be so many python frameworks and so many databases out there to choose from, which is great if one has a lot of knowledge and experience in both python and databases, as one can pick and choose things to fit his needs based on what each can offer or excel in.  \\n  \\nBut, as a novice, how does one go about choosing the right framework or database to learn/work with?

I'll turn on my PC but the monitor only displays \"Entering power save mode\" and then turns off, if I try doing something with the monitor itself it will tell me that it can't receive a signal from the computer. Also, for some reason the computer won't shut down by itself like it usually does. Both of these problems started at the same time.\\n\\nAny help would be appreciated!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",

Or is the time difference negligible?\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",

If it can alternate between events showing above/below and left/right, even better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2\n",

       "So this Christmas I bought an LG 24GM77-B 24 inch monitor for my laptop so I can game in 144hz. I tried connecting the two with an HDMI, and the laptop's hdmi port is 1.4, which is supposed to support up to 120hz. How do I test if my monitor is displaying 144 or 120hz, and what cord would be best for displaying the highest hz supported? Maybe an HDMI to DVI adapter? Any help is greatly appreciated!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2\n",
       "I've been researching different cables that can output 1080P resolution @ 144hz. \\n\\nI've heard DVI-D dual link can. \\n\\nI've heard display port can. \\n\\nBut when it comes to HDMI, I've heard only 2.0 can, I've heard 1.4a and above can, I've heard 1.3 and above can, and I'm completely lost. Does anyone have any hard evidence that shows what HDMI type supports 144hz? Something besides personal set ups, I mean indisputable evidence? Because every time I think I find an answer there's another one contradicting it, and it's gotten pretty tiring. \\nThanks in advance for any help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",

       "Hey guys. I want to combine my 2 desires into one and asking myself if there are others that already tried it.\\n\\n1. I want to learn Rust.\\n\\n2. I want to make games.\\n\\nSo has any of you tried programming a game with Rust? If yes, how was it performancewise? Was it hard getting into Rust and use it for gameprogramming (from a beginnerperspective if possible)? Are there Libs you could use or tutorials?\\n\\nThanks in advance for any answer.\\nSincerely Nyhmus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

Is there a way to only allow certain values for x, y, z when solving an equation, like only positive x or negative y?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "My monitor, the Acer G257HU, is about a year old and has been unplugged for two months while I was away.   \\n\\nYesterday I plugged it back in, it came on for a few seconds, and then went off.  It doesn't turn on at all if I unplug and plug it in again, strangely I have to change outlets for it briefly turn on again.  It never stays on for more than a few seconds. \\n\\nIve been plugging and unplugging it and changing outlets, but it definitely seems dead.  \\n\\nHow does something like this happen?  How could a monitor develop this problem in just two months being turned off and unplugged?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "So some backstory- I'm a sophomore in college majoring in software engineering and just completed my semester and did awful. I think my overall GPA is going to be around a 2.5. I love coding and working with computers. I have only taken two Java classes as my real major classes so far and have made Cs in them, 78.4 in Java 2 this semester. Anyways, my biggest question is will I be able to get a job with this bad GPA or should I look at switching majors? I know I can pull it up but it's only going to get harder for me from here on out. I was just going to ask around and get some opinions, I'm honestly not sure what to do right now. \\n\\nSorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my strong subject. Thanks for any replies in advance, any advice is welcome!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

Any help appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
       "I'm a beginner to the tech world.As far as I know, FLAC and WAV files is the way to go in terms of downloading music, and I would like to know what is the best way to download music and sync it to an my iPhone. I'd also like to know if there is a better way to listen to music rather than the typical iTunes-iphone dealio. Are there phones or music players that are far better? Why is mp3 a lower tier format for music and how does it lose data? Also is there a good direction someone can send me to downloading music and individual songs for free. I have tried a youtube converter but I really want to know a fool proof method to downloading music in it highest quality.

       "[Here is an example](https://i.imgur.com/4MggRmB.png).\\n\\nI generated this with Perlin noise, but this will eventually lead to some blocks being isolated, and I want to avoid that. How can I do something similar to this that 100% guarantees that there is a path from each blue block to every other block?

       "In a few weeks I plan to move into a new apartment with my girlfriend. We are both avid gamers and like to watch Youtube as well. Unfortunately when I went on the CenturyLink website it said that they could only offer me up to 5mbps which is weird because we're going to live in the middle of a fairly big city.  Is this not enough to meet our needs? How much would we need?

       "So I've been given the opportunity to teach young children (elementary) game development starting early next year. Since the school uses Chromebooks Unity is impossible to install so I'm resorting to doing 2D games using JavaScript. I've looked into some libraries such as p5.js which seem to simplify JS as well as offer some graphics options. I'm looking for other libraries that may fit the bill, essentially built in graphics functions, lightweight and not overly complicated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "Hey everyone,\\n\\nLike the title says, I can't make any changes to my color settings (including gamma, etc.) Any changes I make flash for about half a second and then revert back immediately. I've tried doing it through Windows Color Calibration and also through Nvidia Control Panel, but same issue there. Tried all the solutions I was able to find online, but nothing worked so far.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "I've currently built a data collector script that requests data from an API and stores it in a mongo database. Eventually I want to display this data via a django app however first i'd like to host the script on a server where it can collect data without my computer being on.\\n\\nLater I will connect my django app to the db that is hosted on the server. However for now I want to know the best way to host my data collector and db.\\n\\nWould you guys recomend apache ?\\n\\nNB I'm new to hosting scripts on servers/ django, so any noobie notes would be great                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "Hello fellow devs/designers,\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI opened up a local WP project I hadn’t worked on for a couple weeks. It used to work just fine but without having changed anything, suddenly the (static) home page doesn’t open anymore in Google Chrome.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nWhen I go to “localhost:8888” (the default URL for MAMP) the page seems like it’s loading for a while and then I receive the “This site can not be reached” time out error.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nOddly enough the URL redirects to “192.168.1.2:8888”. This doesn’t happen when I type in a specific page URL like “localhost:8888/products”. The page loads without any problems. Admin pages also work fine, as well as the MAMP welcome page and phpMyAdmin.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nAlso, when I go to Appearance -&gt; Customize, it loads my home page just fine, supporting my theory that the redirect is causing the error, though I’m not quite sure why it’s happening.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nWhen I open up Safari the home page loads completely, though it does take a few seconds. I’m not sure if that’s just Safari being slow or if it’s still being redirected and Safari just manages to handle it somehow.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nThings I have tried:\\n\\n- Checking the DB integrity using both WP Repair and phpMyAdmin, as well as checking all post/files/etc in the Admin Dashboard for possible corrupt data.\\n- Changing the ports in MAMP (and in the db).\\n- Defining WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME explicitly in wp-config. Checking the database for the values of WP_SITEURL and WP_HOME. Both are correctly set to http://localhost:8888. I also searched all database tables and project files for the IP 192.168.1.2, just in case I had done something stupid. Only the “wp_posts” table has that IP under the guid column, which I assume is irrelevant (the post pages load fine).\\n- Using my old modem (the only possible thing I remember changing).\\n- Removing all browser cache and cookies.\\n- Logging out of WP, rebooting, etc…i.e. the usual suspects.\\n- Disabling all plugins.\\n- Saving permalink settings again.\\n- Setting a different page as the home page.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nAs you can imagine, it’s getting quite frustrating.

       "So a little background first - this is a fairly new Dell Latitude E6440 laptop running Win10 (anniversary update) that until recently was working fine. Then, ~~the Fire Nation attacked~~ I managed to burn out the motherboard on a docking station with bent pins. Long story short Dell replaced the board, but ever since I've had some issues.\\n\\nCurrently I can get to the login screen on a normal boot, but after ~10-20 seconds the screen goes black, then the laptop shuts down. Booting into safe mode there are no issues. One solution I found had me uninstalling the video adapter and drivers, and following this I can boot normally and use the computer (had to block the automatic reinstallation of the hardware) which keeps me from using multiple monitors at work due to no drivers. \\n\\nHere's where it gets weird - I reinstalled the drivers (either by Windows Update or Dell Command Update) and found that if I have the computer on a docking station with an external monitor or two, the system will not shut down. The original issue presents itself again when removing from the dock and during otherwise unattached startup (even with power adapted plugged in).\\n\\nAnyways, wanted to see if anyone would like to take a whack at this. I'm a little stumped and burnt out on options to try for the moment. I can get by for a while but it's looking like I might just try reinstalling Windows if nothing else works.

       "**SCROLL BELOW FOR THE NEXT BOLD TEXT IF YOU JUST WANT TO SEE THE QUESTION NOT SOME BACKSTORY**\\n\\nI had learned programming when I was 10-12 years old (21 now), wanted to make some games, got a few books and got stuck. This was about creating whole engines, and even when I got their source code it never compiled right, so I stopped.\\n\\nI have done little coding here and there since, and I think it helped my critical thinking and problem solving as I got older, and I am giving it another shot. I wasnt old enough to know about premade game engines, and when I came across one I thought it was making your own games without code, which I didnt want to do.\\n\\nI went to college for finance for 1.5 years, have 1 year of college credits, worked desktop support, and dropped out. Ill save you my life story but I am looking to get into it again, and since I dont have a career path, I had many dreams but unfortunately gave up on them for now, I cannot sit in my parents basement forever.\\n\\nI only will want to make a career out of something I like enjoying though, and passionate about, and I kind of like game programming. I couldnt be passionate about software dev, even though I would like to try it some day, and its not my BIG dream, like that has a 1/bill chance of happening, so I decide I should go safe for a while, and I could always do something related to my dream if I want to later in life.\\n\\n**HERE IS WHERE MY REAL QUESTION BEGINS**\\nSo I have learned Unity, I am creating my first game in C# and everything is going well and I am learning quick. After I get a lot of the core features I want to clean up my code a bit, maybe find easier ways of doing stuff I was doing. It is a 2d incrimental game inspired by Adventure Capitalist. It has some unique features though, and when I am done I think I will throw some art on there, and see how it does on Kongregate and stuff like that. \\n\\nMy main question is though, if I want to be a profession game dev, what is the best way to start with no college experience? I understand making a portfolio is key, but I want to start to try to learn Unity inside and out, then make a ton of different genres of games for a portfolio. I think creatively with games too so I think I make a good designer. Should my first job after my portfolio be like mobile games? Freelance? Would that be the easiest to get hired for? Is there a type of job or internship where I can get paid 1/3-1/2 as much and just learn, and train? I eventually want to do AAA games I think, be a part of a team to make something amazing that most people know to love, and I get to understand the back end of it also.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to learn Unity inside and out? Should I switch to Unreal Engine to learn that inside and out too? What is the difference between them? Do I have to learn anything about making engines? I plan on doing some work on servers like Photon, as I have seen vids of it, and work with mysql too. \\n\\nI am just confused on what order I should be learning everything haha.

However, I'd like to encrypt my backup drive just in case this ever happens again and I'm not quite as lucky.       \\n         \\nWhat software would be best to encrypt the drive with? I'm looking for minimum effort when it comes to decrypting/re-encrypting the drive and if possible, perhaps some backup software that will encrypt on the fly. I'm hesitant to give up freefilesync because it's so damn good, but I'd be willing to jump ship if there exists some good encrypted backup software. Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "I recently purchased a lenovo monitor and went on their website and downloaded the lenovo service bridge because the monitor supports 75 hz and I was only getting 60. Thinking that would solve my problem it didn't and I eventually realized I was still using the old VGA adapter I had, which maxes at 60, and that I needed to use the HDMI supplied with the monitor to achieve 75. Well I uninstalled the Lenovo service bridge application and now upon start up of my laptop I get a pop-up saying \"Cannot Start Application: Application Cannot Be Started.

       "Windows 7 laptop.  It's old, but still....I'm trying to do Windows Update and the level of ridiculously slow is boggling my feeble mind.  Like a half hour to set a Restore Point?  An hour to check for updates?  2 hours to download them?  While waiting I fired up a newer W10 machine and checked the update states there lickety-split.\\n\\nIt finally completed but it has taken half the day.  Do I got something wrong or unexpected here?\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
       "WinDirStat says I have only used [82.3GB](https://gyazo.com/bc85df634f61c92eb32a8572a4a5cf0a) out of my 120GB drive (with [110GB](https://gyazo.com/2bfc1af9eb7669f7db357d58fb1f7293) usuable).

       "I've been programming for almost three years now, have been doing web development using Python and flask for almost a year now and I've been working with Django for about 6 months now. I feel comfortable in creating basic apps that use the Wagtail CMS and also I believe I have grasped the basics of Django down. I also know how to launch projects on Digital Ocean with the configurations needed to make it run. When it comes to front-end, I definitely wouldn't consider myself a designer but I am proficient in using Javascript, CSS and bootstrap. But is this enough for me to find work as a Django Developer as of this point? Obviously I will continue learning as much as possible but do I need to develop more skills in order to get clients or can I start off just creating simple websites for clients using Django? \\nIf so would Django be overkill? \\n\\nI love Python and the Django framework with the Wagtail CMS which is why I'm trying to avoid using WordPress and PHP.\\n\\nCheers!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "Hi,\\n\\nI've recently released my new game and since then I got ~1 400 downloads on Google play and ~1 500 downloads from \"oudside sources\" meaning China's APK-hosting websites (and none chinese downloads in GP).\\n\\n\\nRetention in China isn't that great but I would like to make the most of it cause the topic is obviously popular there. \\n\\nSo what do you think? How can I make the most of it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
